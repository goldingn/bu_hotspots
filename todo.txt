get more BU data

add intercept and terms for possums and scats (log-linear)

add dates and date lag woth prior of 5 months - need to split by time to do the temporal PPM? Or some other approximation?

train/test split by time (pair with lagged scat data)

model evaluation (fraction of cases in highest-density region?)
